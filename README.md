#Fuzzy Search

This project is the implementation of the technical assessment posed byt the Clip team.
To preview the project follow this link: <https://jcalvarado.github.io/clip/>

##Requirements

**Implement a fuzzy search algorithm for transactions with the following requirements:**

- Have a web page with one input field where a user can enter text, and a displayed list of transactions
- Display the full list of transactions when the input field is empty
- Update the displayed list of transactions as the user types in the input field (only show transactions that match the fuzzy search criteria)
- Show the transactions in order by date
- Fuzzy search must account for all transaction object properties (amount, date, card_last_four)
- You may use any front-end library (we currently use ReactJS) for the design/architecture of the application, but you may not use a library for the actual search algorithm
- You can hardcode the transaction data found below and do not need to fetch it from a server
- Unit tests are encouraged

Please use the following list of transactions:

const transactions = [
{ amount: 112.98, date: '27-01-2018T12:34', card_last_four: '2544' },
{ amount: 0.45, date: '01-12-2017T9:36', card_last_four: '4434' },
{ amount: 95.99, date: '23-11-2017T14:34', card_last_four: '3011' },
{ amount: 7774.32, date: '17-07-2017T03:34', card_last_four: '6051' },
{ amount: 1345.98, date: '22-06-2017T10:33', card_last_four: '0059' },
{ amount: 2850.70, date: '27-01-2018T12:34', card_last_four: '4444' },
{ amount: 45.00, date: '10-02-2018T02:34', card_last_four: '0110' },
{ amount: 1.00, date: '17-02-2018T18:34', card_last_four: '1669' },
{ amount: 4.69, date: '01-02-2018T02:34', card_last_four: '8488' },
{ amount: 1111.11, date: '15-01-2018T21:34', card_last_four: '9912' }
];

## Getting started

Install all node dependencies: `npm install`

To run a development server: `npm start`

To run tests: `npm test`

To make a production build: `npm run build`
After building the project you can oiptionally run it locally from your build folder with:

```
sudo npm install -g serve
cd ./build
serve
```

## Features

- Bootstrapped with Create-React-App.
- ReactJS as the UI framework.
- MobX for state management.
- Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance for the fuzzy search algorithm.
